<h1>StreamClick-Ott platform (Frontend)</h1>

Introducing the StreamClick website for all those who love binge-watching and theater-like experiences. The screen has various elements of the Glass effect to give the users the feel of the theater. Also, it is an all-in-one platform where users can subscribe to multiple OTT platforms. You can access your favorite content and list content you want to enjoy later. 
Also, stability and low buffering time are the utmost requirements for the OTT app, and React provides just that. Along with the Front-end, we give the back-end services like the admin panel development with the robust NodeJS platform. React has a vast supportive community, and the developers can construct the OTT platform in a shorter time thanks to isomorphic code development.
